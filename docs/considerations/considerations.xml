    <title>Interoperation with the GLib test framework</title>
    <para>
      To minimise the amount of code (and the opportunity for bugs), GTU
      depends on GLib test APIs for providing certain functionality. However,
      we also rewrite functionality or hack around GLib's implementation when
      it isn't sufficiently flexible for our purposes. The end result is that
      much of GLib's test API cannot be used alongside GTU.
    </para>

    <para>
      This is a list of GLib test functions that should work as normal:

    <para>
      The following is a (possibly incomplete) list of GLib functionality that
      will provoke undefined behaviour if used in tandem with GTU:

    <para>
      Additionally, test suites using GTU are incompatible with GLib's
      <command>gtester</command> utility.
