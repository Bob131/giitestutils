    <title>What and Why?</title>
    <para>
      Whilst enormously handy, GLib's testing framework can be somewhat
      cumbersome:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        Building test suites with
        <link linkend="GTestCase"><classname>GTestCase</classname></link>
        involves a lot of boilerplate, which can be particularly frustrating
        if most of your tests don't require complicated fixtures.
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        Test cases are required to use a separate (less flexible) asserts
        API, as
        <link linkend="g-assert"><function>g_assert()</function></link>
        and
        <link linkend="g-assert-not-reached"><function>g_assert_not_reached()</function></link>
        always abort the program regardless of
        <link linkend="g-test-set-nonfatal-assertions"><function>g_test_set_nonfatal_assertions()</function></link>
        .
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        Test cases are required to check the results of assertions and
        explicitly return on failure, making it easy to write buggy tests by
        mistake.
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
      Given that the testing framework is part of GLib proper and is designed
      to be reasonably flexible, these are understandable issues to have; in
      many testing-specific scenarios, however, it may be preferable to trade
      in some flexibility and correctness for added convenience.
    </para>

    <para>
      GTU aims to fill this gap: without the burden of being a general-purpose
      batteries-included library, we can use mechanisms that might otherwise be
      considered uncouth to make things simpler.
    </para>

    <title>The <emphasis>What</emphasis> Test Utilities?</title>
    <para>
      'GTU' is an abbreviation for 'Gii Test Utilities'. 'Gii' is pronounced
      just like 'Gee' (the name from which it's derived); the only connection
      between GTU and another
      <ulink url="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libgee">GLib-based utility library</ulink>
      is a common cute name.
