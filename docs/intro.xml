    <title>What and Why?</title>
    <para>
      Whilst enormously handy, GLib's testing framework can be somewhat
      cumbersome:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        Building test suites with #GTestCase involves a lot of boilerplate,
        which can be particularly frustrating if most of your tests don't
        require complicated fixtures.
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        Test cases are required to use a separate (less flexible) asserts API,
        as g_assert() and g_assert_not_reached() always abort the program
        regardless of g_test_set_nonfatal_assertions() .
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        Test cases are required to check the results of assertions and
        explicitly return on failure, making it easy to write buggy tests by
        mistake.
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
      Given that the testing framework is part of GLib proper and designed to
      be reasonably flexible, these are understandable issues to have; in many
      testing-specific scenarios, however, it may be preferable to trade in
      some flexibility and correctness for added convenience.
    </para>

    <para>
      GTU aims to fill this gap: without the burden of being a general purpose
      batteries-included library, we can use mechanisms that might otherwise be
      considered uncouth to make things simpler.

    <title>The <emphasis>What</emphasis> Test Utilities?</title>
    <para>
      'GTU' is an abbreviation for 'Gii Test Utilities'. 'Gii' is pronounced
      just like 'Gee' (the name from which it's derived); the only connection
      between GTU and another
      <ulink url="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libgee">GLib-based utility library</ulink>
      is a common cute name.
